# **Van Dyke Press Application**

## Purpose

---

<br>
Van Dyke Press - A printing company that produces specialty food grade labels have requested the recreation of an existing website. The websites main objective is to advertise the variety of labels that the company can produce and what Van Dyke Press is all about. The client is looking for a modern cutting edge look to illustrate how the company is the leader in their field.

The company will experience ongoing development in the future years and will want to showcase that through Blog posts which will keep the user updated on the company.

In the past, there have been trouble with client jobs being misplaced/ not recorded which has resulted in miscommunication between the company and their clients. Therefore a login system with a private dashboard for the sales representatives that deal with all job orders will be needed to keep track of each job lifecycle.

The company will need a page providing contact information to be sent to the owner for any enquiries for potential leads on new jobs.

## Functionality/Features

<br>

**Home Page**
<br>
<br>
The Home page is one of the most integral parts for the owner of the company, to draw the attention of the viewer and portray what the company does and the different products that available. For that reason there will be several different <strong>animations/effects </strong>the Home Page will have to captivate, such as scale effects, flippable cards, on scroll animations and more. The Layout of the page along with varying colour pallets will help distinguish different elements of the page to show separation.
<br>
<br>

**Login Page**
<br>
<br>
There will be a login page where the sales representatives of the company can login with their private login credentials and upon successful login, take them to their private dashboard. The owner does not wish anyone viewing the website to be able to create an account, therefore the owner has the role of admin who has the ability to create new users. Therefore there will be register page.
<br>
<br>

**Dashboard Page**
<br>
<br>
The Dashboard will be home for the sales representatives so that they can create and update different jobs that come in to the company and categorize the job based on the process the job is at. To access a certain job more easily, a search bar will be in place. Three different buttons will be in place to locate to jobs of a certain process category (Job Created, Job in Progress, Job Completed, Job Sent Out). A logout button will be present so that the user can leave whenever they wish.

The form will not be able to send if there are missing fields/ invalid details. A Phone number and email address will also be provided for future correspondence.
